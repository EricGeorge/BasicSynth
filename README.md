# BasicSynth

BasicSynth is an exercise to explore some of the modules that were described in Will Pirkle's book Designing Software Synthesizers in C++ and implement them on iOS.
 
The following resources were helpful in putting together this project:
 - The main sample from Apple that demonstrates AU v3 and AU v3 Host implementation:  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/AudioUnitV3Example/Introduction/Intro.html
 - The book:  https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Software-Synthesizer-Plug-Ins-RackAFX/dp/1138787078/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=
 - Martin Finke's Audio Plug-In Tutorial:  http://www.martin-finke.de/blog/
 
This synth has terrible UI setup for testing and doesn't sound great - but neither was the point.  I built it more as a starting template for making iOS synths.  It runs as an AUv3 and also installs it's own stand alone host.
